## Data and scripts from the study "Assessing the Adequacy of Morphological Models used in Palaeobiology"


**1. Empirical-Inf**

This contains everything for the empirical analysis. 
Data directroy contains all the morphological data sets analysed. 
Scripts direcroy contains all rev scripts for inference and Rscripts for down stream analysis. 

`Start.sh` will run all data sets under the 7 models.

**2. PPS Simulations**

This contains the set up for the simulation study. 

###### Simulation Directory

Data was simualted using the `Sim.r` file. 
The Data directory contains the output from the empirical inference of Egi and Shoshani for 
four different models. Simulated data sets are in the data_model directories.
Scripts contains all the rev scripts used for the inference. 
To simulate data, you need to specify the model, data set, and runID. This requires eidting the Sim.r file directly, lines 41-45
